A repository for solving the Advent of Code problems.

- `solutions` contains the solutions for the problems, separated by year and day.
- `bin` contains an executable for quickly scaffolding a new folder for a new day.
- `lib` contains `aoc_std`, a library extending and bundling `core`, `angstrom` and `iter` for easier importing.
- `test` contains some tests for `lib`.

The inputs are omitted from this repository because [the author doesn't want them to be distributed](https://adventofcode.com/about).
